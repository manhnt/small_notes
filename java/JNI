1. Generate C header file and source file from a Java class file
================================================================
Use the javah command:
$ javah -jni <fully-qualified-class-name>
(-jni option tells the commadn to create an file containing JNI-style native
 method function prototypes. It is enable by default).
For example, fully-qualified name of your class file is com.example.YourFile.class,
and your directory structure is <user>/java/project/com/example/YourFile.class,
you need to run the following command from the <user>/java/project/ directory:
$ javah -jni com.example.YourFile
