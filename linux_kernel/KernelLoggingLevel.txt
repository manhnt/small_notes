When working in the kernel, usually you will use 'printk' function to print a
kernel message (the 'printk' function is defined in kernel/prink/prink.c). The
kernels allows each message to be classified with a log level. This level is
passed as an additional string at the beginning of the 1st argument. For
example:
    printk(KERN_ALERT "Woe Woo Woe Woo!\n");
No priority means a default value is used (default is MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT
which is defined in include/linux/printk.h, which is then can be set via the
CONFIG_MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT value in kernel configuration).

These log level are defined in 'include/linux/kernel_levels.h' as simple
strings:
#define KERN_EMERG	KERN_SOH "0"	/* system is unusable */
#define KERN_ALERT	KERN_SOH "1"	/* action must be taken immediately */
#define KERN_CRIT	KERN_SOH "2"	/* critical conditions */
#define KERN_ERR	KERN_SOH "3"	/* error conditions */
#define KERN_WARNING	KERN_SOH "4"	/* warning conditions */
#define KERN_NOTICE	KERN_SOH "5"	/* normal but significant condition */
#define KERN_INFO	KERN_SOH "6"	/* informational */
#define KERN_DEBUG	KERN_SOH "7"	/* debug-level messages */

(The C preprocessor will automatically combines these strings with your
specific-format message string into a single string)

The printk configuration parameters in /proc file system:
    $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/printk
    4   4   1   7
These values denote: your current console_loglevel, default_message_loglevel,
minimum_console_level and default_console_loglevel respectively. You can only
change the first value of the system, by simply writing to this file. For
example, if you want all messages printed to the console:
    # echo 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
Only messages with loglevel value lower (NOT lower or equal) than the
console_loglevel will be printed to the console.
