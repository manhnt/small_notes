How to generate preprocessed source code of kernel module soure file:

If you only plan to get the preprocessed output of kernel module, don't use
Makefile, cause Makefiles (sub-make) will try to produce an object file with
ability to insert into the kernel. Which contradicts with gcc -E, which just
stops after preprocessing. So, just do the followings by using gcc:

  gcc -E new.c -I$TREE/include -I$TREE/arch/x86/include -I$TREE/include/uapi

where new.c is name of source file.
-E is to get the preprocessed output, $TREE is the location of your kernel
tree and if you use other arch then change x86. And we know that, gcc takes
include dir parameter with -I, so pass all the kernel include dir through -I.
Hope this helps!
