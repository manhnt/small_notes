Set permanent environment variable:
Session-wide environment variables

Suitable files for environment variable settings that should affect just a
particular user (rather than the system as a whole) are ~/.pam_environment and
~/.profile. After having edited one of those files, you should re-login in order
to initialize the variables.

Example: 
- 1st step: open ~/.pam_environment (create the file if haven't exist). Assign
new variable:
APPENED_PATH=/the/path/that/you/want/to/add
Save the file.
- 2nd step: open ~/.profile to edit:
export PATH="$PATH:$APPENDED_PATH"

Save the file. Then to apply the changes right away, run
$ source .profile
Check the result:
$ echo $PATH
