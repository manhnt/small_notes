Showing GRUB mene at boot by default
====================================
If Ubuntu is the only OS on the machine, the GRUB boot menu may not show at
boot time. But in some cases, it is desirable to have the menu displayed so
you could add some kernel boot configurations, or do something to particular
requirements. So in order to make the GRUB menu be visible by default, make
edit to the file /etc/default/grub to comment out the line which has
GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0, then run update-grub to apply changes.

Boot into virtual console mode by default
